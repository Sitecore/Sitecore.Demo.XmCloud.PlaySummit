# The public URL to use for absolute URLs, which are required when
# the Next.js app is run within Sitecore editors.
# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \src\platform\App_Config\Include\Sitecore.Demo.Edge.Website.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.

# To secure the Sitecore editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
